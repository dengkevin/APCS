
/**
 *  The purpose of this interface is to facilitate the determination
 *  of which objects a Jumper can remove by jumping on them.
 *  It is awkward and error prone to modify Jumper's canMove when a new
 *  actor class is created.  Instead, this design uses the Edible
 *  interface.  If an actor implements Edible, it can be jumped on,
 *  otherwise it can't.  Currently Jumper implements Edible.
 *  Note that implementing Edible does not require an actor class to
 *  implement any additional methods.  The only method in Edible
 *  (removeSelfFromGrid) is already implemented in Actor, which is
 *  extended by the new class.
